  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Akshar Gupta, a technical content developer at Udacity. My work sits at
    the intersection of AI and course design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I'm interested in origami, reading, and building things with code.
  </p>
  <p>
    This website is my home on the internet - a place to share what I'm learning,
    thinking about, and creating.
